/*Comments*/

/* Multi-line comments
are created like with a forward slash and asterisk - the asterisk on the inside. 
The keyboard shortcut is Ctrl + / */

/* One stylistic convention is to 
** use asterisks at the start of each line
** to make it more aligned/readable. */

-- Single line comments can be created with a double dash
